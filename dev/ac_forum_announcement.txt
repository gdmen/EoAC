Hello folks,

Over the past 9 months, I've spent hundreds of hours on this pet project of mine. I'd like to introduce you to the public BETA of. . .
[url=http://hype-clan.com/eyeofac]Eye of AC[/url], a screenshot sharing application for AssaultCube!

When you run EoAC, it starts up your normal AssaultCube client and then:
[list=1]
[*]Automatically uploads your screenshots while you play AC.
[*]Saves metadata about the screenshots including players in game, scores, and more!
[*]Allows you to [url=http://hype-clan.com/eyeofac/feed.php]search and sort[/url] yours and others' screenshots on the EoAC website.
[/list]


EoAC is a simple drag-and-drop addition to your AssaultCube directory. You can download EoAC [url=http://hype-clan.com/eyeofac/download.php]here[/url].

Future features:
[list=1]
[*]Blacklist command: '/bl <cn> <reason>'
(for example: /bl 2 far knife).
This will give you a copy-pasteable BBCode segment for the AC forum blacklist thread.
[*]Tags & Albums!
[*]Full mobile resolution support for the EoAC website.
[/list]


EoAC has been under development and in-game testing for months, but this is a BETA release and there will quite likely be bugs. EoAC comes with a robust logging system and a [url=http://hype-clan.com/eyeofac/forum/viewforum.php?id=2]bug reporting forum[/url]. Please report issues so we can get them fixed!

[url=http://hype-clan.com/eyeofac/forum/viewforum.php?id=9]You can even help decide what features EoAC will have next![/url]

[b]Many thanks to the people who have helped![/b]
